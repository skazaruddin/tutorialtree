## Introduction

Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and manage project history efficiently. Below is a comprehensive list of Git commands along with their descriptions and examples.

### Git Commands

####  `git init`
Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

**Usage:**
```sh
git init
```
When starting a new project, we typically create the necessary project folder structure or use a project generator to set up a template based on the programming language we are using. Once the project structure is ready, we want to start tracking our codebase, which is where `git init` comes into play.

**Best Practice:**
Before initializing the Git repository, it is a good practice to create a `.gitignore` file in the project's root folder. The `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git. This is crucial to prevent unnecessary or sensitive files from being tracked and included in version control, such as build artifacts, dependency directories, and configuration files with sensitive information.

**Why create a `.gitignore` file first?**
1. **Prevents Unnecessary Files from Being Tracked:** Certain files and directories, like `node_modules` for Node.js projects or compiled binaries for various programming languages, are typically not needed in version control.
2. **Improves Repository Size and Performance:** By ignoring files that change frequently or are large, we can keep the repository size manageable and improve performance.
3. **Protects Sensitive Information:** Configuration files that contain sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, should not be tracked to avoid security risks.

**Usage:**
```sh
# Step 1: Create a .gitignore file in the root of your project
echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore
echo "*.log" >> .gitignore
echo "build/" >> .gitignore
echo ".idea/" >> .gitignore  # IntelliJ IDEA
echo "*.iml" >> .gitignore   # IntelliJ IDEA project files
echo ".vscode/" >> .gitignore  # Visual Studio Code
echo "target/" >> .gitignore  # Maven/Gradle target directory
echo "*.class" >> .gitignore  # Java class files
echo ".settings/" >> .gitignore  # Eclipse settings
echo ".project" >> .gitignore  # Eclipse project file
echo ".classpath" >> .gitignore  # Eclipse classpath file
echo "out/" >> .gitignore  # IntelliJ IDEA output directory
echo ".DS_Store" >> .gitignore  # macOS Finder metadata
echo "Thumbs.db" >> .gitignore  # Windows Explorer thumbnail cache
echo "*.swp" >> .gitignore  # vi/vim swap files
echo ".gradle/" >> .gitignore  # Gradle files
echo "dist/" >> .gitignore  # Distribution directory
echo "coverage/" >> .gitignore  # Code coverage reports
echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore  # Node.js dependencies
echo "yarn.lock" >> .gitignore  # Yarn dependency lock file
echo "npm-debug.log" >> .gitignore  # npm debug log


# Step 2: Initialize a new Git repository
git init
```

**Example:**
1. **Create Project Structure:**
   ```
   my-project/
   ├── src/
   ├── tests/
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── README.md
   ```

2. **Edit `.gitignore`:**
   ```
   # Dependencies
   node_modules/
   # Logs
   *.log
      
   # Build outputs
   build/ 
   dist/
   target/
   
   # IDEs and editors
   .idea/
   *.iml 
   .vscode/
   .settings/ 
   .project
   .classpath 
   out/
      
   # macOS Finder metadata 
   .DS_Store
      
   # Windows Explorer thumbnail cache 
   Thumbs.db
      
   # vi/vim swap files 
   *.swp
      
   # Gradle 
   .gradle/
      
   # Code coverage 
   coverage/
      
   # Yarn 
   yarn.lock
      
   # npm debug log 
   npm-debug.log
   ```

3. **Initialize Git Repository:**
   ```sh
   cd my-project
   git init
   ```

By following these steps, you ensure that your repository is clean and free of unnecessary files from the very beginning. This practice sets a strong foundation for maintaining a well-organized and efficient project.



### `git clone`
Clones a repository from a remote source to your local machine.

**Usage:**
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
```

**Example:**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

### `git add`
Stages changes in the working directory for the next commit.

**Usage:**
```sh
git add <file-or-directory>
```

**Example:**
```sh
git add README.md
```

### `git status`
Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.

**Usage:**
```sh
git status
```

### `git commit`
Records changes to the repository with a message.

**Usage:**
```sh
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

### `git push`
Uploads local repository content to a remote repository.

**Usage:**
```sh
git push <remote> <branch>
```

**Example:**
```sh
git push origin main
```

### `git pull`
Fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository into the current branch.

**Usage:**
```sh
git pull <remote> <branch>
```

**Example:**
```sh
git pull origin main
```

## Branching and Merging

### `git branch`
Lists all branches in the repository or creates a new branch.

**Usage:**
```sh
git branch
```
or
```sh
git branch <branch-name>
```

**Example:**
```sh
git branch feature-xyz
```

### `git checkout`
Switches branches or restores working directory files.

**Usage:**
```sh
git checkout <branch-name>
```
or
```sh
git checkout <commit-hash> <file>
```

**Example:**
```sh
git checkout feature-xyz
```

### `git merge`
Merges changes from one branch into the current branch.

**Usage:**
```sh
git merge <branch-name>
```

**Example:**
```sh
git merge feature-xyz
```

### `git rebase`
Reapplies commits on top of another base tip.

**Usage:**
```sh
git rebase <branch>
```

**Example:**
```sh
git rebase main
```

## Remote Repositories

### `git remote`
Manages set of tracked repositories.

**Usage:**
```sh
git remote
```
or
```sh
git remote add <name> <url>
```

**Example:**
```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

### `git fetch`
Downloads objects and refs from another repository.

**Usage:**
```sh
git fetch <remote>
```

**Example:**
```sh
git fetch origin
```

## Undoing Changes

### `git reset`
Resets current HEAD to the specified state.

**Usage:**
```sh
git reset <commit>
```
or
```sh
git reset --hard <commit>
```

**Example:**
```sh
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### `git revert`
Creates a new commit that undoes the changes made by a previous commit.

**Usage:**
```sh
git revert <commit>
```

**Example:**
```sh
git revert d3adb33f
```

## Viewing History

### `git log`
Shows the commit logs.

**Usage:**
```sh
git log
```

**Example:**
```sh
git log --oneline
```

### `git diff`
Shows the changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.

**Usage:**
```sh
git diff
```
or
```sh
git diff <commit>
```

**Example:**
```sh
git diff HEAD~1
```
